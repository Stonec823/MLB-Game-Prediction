Predicting baseball pitches through classification using MLB Statcast data


Background: 

There's no advantage in baseball quite like knowing what pitch is coming. Whether the pitcher is unintentionally giving away their pitches (aka "tipping"), or whether the batting team is using some elaborate scheme to steal signs, there is always a desire for some kind of knowledge about the next pitch. One of the hardest parts of hitting is adjusting to the different speeds and spins on the fly. Most methods of stealing signs are illegal, or at the least frowned upon. With the sport rapidly incoroporating more and more analytics, it may be beneficial for hitters to know certain patterns for pitchers they're facing by knowing the most likely pitch. 

Research Question:

How accurately, if at all, can pitch type be predicted for an MLB pitcher?
