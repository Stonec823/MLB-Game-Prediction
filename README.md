Predicting baseball pitches through classification using MLB Statcast data


Background: 

There's no advantage in baseball quite like knowing what pitch is coming. Whether the pitcher is unintentionally giving away their pitches (aka "tipping"), or whether the batting team is using some elaborate scheme to steal signs, there is always a desire for some kind of knowledge about the next pitch. One of the hardest parts of hitting is adjusting to the different speeds and spins on the fly. Most methods of stealing signs are illegal, or at the least frowned upon. But in theory, there is nothing preventing a hitter from being relayed an educated guess from their coaching staff, right?

Research Question:

How accurately, if at all, can pitch type be predicted for an MLB pitcher?
